# odin-recipes

*PROJECT PREP*

This project is about creating a static website about 3 different recipes. I'll be using HTML to start and later be adding CSS to style. Will need to implement anchors to link multiple recipes, lists to order the ingredients, images of each of the 3 selected recipes.

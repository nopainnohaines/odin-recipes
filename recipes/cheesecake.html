    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>2½ pounds cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1¾ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>5 eggs</li>
      <li>2 egg yolks</li>
      <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat a 10 inch
        spring-form pan with spray oil. Note: You could use a 9x13 inch pan
        instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the crust: Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 egg and
        1/2 cup butter or margarine. Spread to the edges of the pan. Prick all
        over with a fork, then bake 15 minutes at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
        Allow to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase oven temperature to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). In a large
        bowl, combine cream cheese, 1 3/4 cups sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, 5
        eggs and the yolks and mix thoroughly. Add cream and mix only enough to
        blend.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour filling over crust and bake for 10 minutes at 475 degrees F (245
        degrees C). Reduce temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and
        continue to bake for one hour. Turn oven off, but leave cake in for
        another hour. Don't worry if it looks a little jiggly in the center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chill overnight. This is imperative! If desired, top with your favorite
        fruit or serve plain.
      </li>
    </ol>

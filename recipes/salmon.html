    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 untreated cedar planks</li>
      <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>¾ cup honey</li>
      <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>6 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless salmon fillets</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak the cedar planks in warm water for 1 to 2 hours. Add a splash of
        bourbon to the water if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the pineapple juice, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, olive oil,
        and honey to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Reduce the
        heat to medium-low, and stir in the sugar, 1 teaspoon black pepper,
        cayenne pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Simmer, stirring
        occasionally, until the sauce has reduced to a syrupy consistency, about
        15 minutes. Set the sauce aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Place the planks on the grate.
        They are ready to cook on when they start to smoke and crackle just a
        little.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the salmon with a light sprinkling of salt and pepper. Place the
        fillets onto the smoking cedar planks, close the lid of the grill, and
        cook for 10 minutes. Spoon a small amount of the sauce over the salmon
        fillets, and continue cooking until the fish turns opaque in the center,
        about 5 minutes more. Serve with the remaining sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
